Over the past 5 years i have been developing the applications on PHP and MySql platform And designing(HTML5/CSS3) for my projects. I developed wide range of applications. And also i had very good experience with designing(HTML5/CSS3/Photoshop). I have consistently delivered projects on time and under budget, which has earned me the role of team lead on a number of recent projects, as you'll see in my work history. I believe my skills would be ideal for your project.

Still you want to test my skills then you can allow me for test task. You hire me only if i satisfy you with test run.....
